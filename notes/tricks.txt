In Django, the loaddata command loads data from a fixture into the database. By default, it doesn't overwrite existing data. However, you can achieve the effect of overwriting by:
1. Truncating the tables:
Before loading:
Use the manage.py sqlflush command or manually truncate the relevant tables in your database. This will delete all existing data in those tables.
Then load:
Run manage.py loaddata <fixturename> to load your fixture data into the now-empty tables.

manage.py loaddata <app_name>
